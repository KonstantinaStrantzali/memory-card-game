<p>This is a Marvel Memory Card Game which is targeted at the prospective users who are interested in playing memory games. Cards are shuffled randomly and players allowed to flip only 2 cards over at a turn while playing. If the flipped cards match they stay open if not they flip back over. The game is finished when players reach the 15 turns limit number and a modal pops up ending the game or asking to try again.</p>
